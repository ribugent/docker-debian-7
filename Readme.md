**UPDATE: Finally Debian 7 is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/debian/eol, use image from here**

# Readme

This repository contains my Debian 7 dockerfile which I use on some environment haven't been migrated yet.

The reason why I created this repo is that the current image on https://hub.docker.com/_/debian has a not working `/etc/apt/sources.list` and has not been added yet to https://hub.docker.com/r/debian/eol

So I'll use this image until is migrated
